# Transit808
The Bus Arrival Time/Trip Planner  
University of Hawaii at Manoa ICS 466 Project

### Background
This is an open source transit app developed to provide real-time arrival information for [TheBus](http://www.thebus.org). The app also provides directions between two locations using the [Google Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/). The app is built in Android  using [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com) and was tested using the [GenyMotion](http://www.genymotion.com) Android emulator.

### Setup
Here are the steps to get the app running:

1. Download a local copy to your machine from this page. You can use either the "Clone to Desktop" or "Download Zip" links on the side of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/eduardgamiao/Transit808/) to download a copy. Unzip the file into your preferred location.
2. Open Android Studio, click `File` -> `Import Project`.
3. Select the folder where you unzipped the file to. This will import the project into Android Studio.
4. Before running, you will need to add a file that will store the API Keys for [TheBus HEA](http://hea.thebus.org/api_info.asp) and [Google Maps/Places](https://console.developers.google.com/project). Follow the directions at those links to receive an API Key. You will need a Google Places Browser Key and a Google Maps API Key.
